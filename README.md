Welcome to my repository for the projects completed during my Udacity Blockchain Developer Nanodegree program. This repository contains implementations of various blockchain applications, as well as smart contracts and decentralized applications.

## Projects

The following is a list of the projects completed during the Nanodegree program:

1. **Project 1:** Create Your Own Private Blockchain
2. **Project 2:** Build CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum
3. **Project 3:** Supply Chain & Provenance
4. **Project 4:** Flight Surety

Each project has its own folder within this repository, containing the necessary files to run and test the code.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine, as well as the Truffle framework and Ganache. Additionally, some projects may require additional libraries, which will be listed in the project's `README` file.

## Usage

To run a project, navigate to the project's directory and follow the instructions in the project's `README` file.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Udacity and its instructors for providing the materials and guidance necessary to complete this Nanodegree program. Additionally, I would like to thank the open source community for providing many of the tools and libraries used in these projects.
